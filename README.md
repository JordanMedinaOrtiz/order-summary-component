  This project is a solution to the "Order Summary Component" challenge from Frontend Mentor. It was developed as a practical exercise to reinforce core HTML and CSS skills, with a particular focus on semantic HTML structure, the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology, and the effective use of Flexbox for layout. It offers an excellent opportunity for beginners to build confidence in crafting clean, structured web components.
